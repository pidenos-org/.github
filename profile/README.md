## Hi there 👋
Pidenos is a community-driven assistance platform that connects individuals in need of help (Requesters) with Volunteers willing to offer their time and skills. Users can request assistance in various categories such as home services, personal care, transportation, and knowledge sharing. The platform facilitates the entire process — from request creation to completion of the help — matching people based on factors such as proximity, availability, and experience.  
> *Our mission is to connect people in need with those who are ready to help, creating a supportive community where assistance is just a click away. In light of the devastating floods in Valencia, Spain—the worst in decades—we are committed to providing a platform where individuals can offer and receive help in real time. Whether it’s delivering essential supplies, offering transportation, or lending a helping hand with home repairs, our goal is to bring relief and hope to those affected.*

> *We want to empower communities everywhere to support each other. Together, we can make a difference—one act of kindness at a time.* 🌍💙
